# AVL-Tree-Project
## Project 1 - Data Structures

Welcome to my AVL Tree project. The actual code for the AVL tree is stored within "AVLTree.h" while the code used for data validation and main implementation are stored within "DataValidation.h" and "main.cpp" respectively.

The AVL tree provides a lot of advantages over a standard binary search tree because of how the tree balances itself after insertions and deleteions. This makes it way more time effective when it comes to storing and manipulating large amounts of data.
